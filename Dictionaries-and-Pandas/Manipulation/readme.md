Dictionary Manipulation (1):
If you know how to access a dictionary, you can also assign a new value to it. To add a new key-value pair to europe you can use something like this:

europe['iceland'] = 'reykjavik'


Instructions:
Add the key 'italy' with the value 'rome' to europe.
To assert that 'italy' is now a key in europe, print out 'italy' in europe.
Add another key:value pair to europe: 'poland' is the key, 'warsaw' is the corresponding value.
Print out europe.




Dictionary Manipulation (2):
Somebody thought it would be funny to mess with your accurately generated dictionary. An adapted version of the europe dictionary is available in the script.

Can you clean up? Do not do this by adapting the definition of europe, but by adding Python commands to the script to update and remove key:value pairs.

Instructions:
The capital of Germany is not 'bonn'; it's 'berlin'. Update its value.
Australia is not in Europe, Austria is! Remove the key 'australia' from europe.
Print out europe to see if your cleaning work paid off.
